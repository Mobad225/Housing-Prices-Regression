# Housing-Prices-Regression
Following the steps from the Hands-on Machine Learning 2 book, I understood and re-implemented this project, 
which is basically a thorough pass on what a usual Machine Learning Project is like.
1) Data understanding and quick visualization.
  -Understanding the data I will deal with and its types
  -Visualize the data quickly if needed
2) Data cleaning & preparation
  -Create a pipeline for numerical attributes
     -May Add/Remove Attributes
     -Fill/Disregard Attributes with missing data
     -Scale the data (Normalization or Standardization)
     (May be more if needed)
  -Create a pipeline for categorical attributes
     -May change them to onehot encoding
     -May change replace them with representative numerical values
     -May Add/Remove Attributes
  -Create a ColumnTransformer to send appropriate columns to their pipelines
3) Select and train models and shortlist a few
4) Evaluate the models using validation sets
5) Fine-tune the Model
  -Using GridSearchCV I can easily tune the hyperparameters to given parameters
  -Using RandomizedSearchCV I can easily tune the hyperparameters by trying random parameters
6) Check the importances of attributes in the best estimator
  -Might need to delete un-important attributes
7) Evaluate the model on the test set!
